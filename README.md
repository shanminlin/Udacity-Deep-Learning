# Udacity-Deep-Learning

This reposity contains project I completed for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Bike sharing
In this project, we built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset on bike sharing. 

## Project 2: Generating TV Scripts
In this project, we generated own own TV scripts using RNNs. 

## Project 3: Face Generation
In this project, we used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

## Project 4: Model Deployment
In this project, we built and deploy a RNN model using  AWS sagemaker.
